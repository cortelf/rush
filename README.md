# Rush

Simple Webserver on python3, like Flask, but not Flask. I wanna make it as fast as I can (without using asynchronous code). Additional description will be provided later, when I'll be able to release first alpha version

Branches:
  - master - main branch where all the features appear first
  - release-x.x.x - releases of webserver
  - for-history - old triple-rank system, that doesn't seems to be workable (I didn't test it completely)

How to run:
  - You need environment variable PYTHONPATH be set to .../rush folder
  - Module with user handlers are entry point (`python3 userhandlers/your_handlers.py`)
